## Include
-----
Download the file and include `scale.js` in your document after including jQuery.
```html
	<!-- Your <head> -->
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="soon available" > </script>
```
## Usage
--------
### Via data attributes
To easily scale an element, add `data-scale` to the element you want to use, and specify a scale factor ( see the example below), then you can also specify a unit for responsive text  ( like `vh` or `vh` or something else ) by adding `data-unit` to the same element.

**Syntax:**
```html
<p data-scale="factor" data-unit="unit" style=" font-size='10px' "> Sample </p>
<!-- Text size will be -->
<!-- 10 x factor = result unit -->
```

**Example:**

```html
<p data-scale="0.2" data-unit="vw" style=" font-size='10px' "> Hello World </p>
<!-- Text size will be -->
<!-- 10 x 0.2 = 2vw -->
```

### Via Javascript
To call the scale plugin manually, simply select your target element with **jQuery** and do the following:
```javascript
	$("selector").scale( factor, { unit: 'unit' } );
```
**Example:**
```javascript
    $('selector').scale( 1, { unit: 'px' } );
```
# Note:

* To make a text responsive you need to scale it via JavaScript, in this case don't worry if console alerts you who there aren't targets with `data-scale` / `data-unit` attributes.
